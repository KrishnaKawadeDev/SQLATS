        <h2 class="Heading2">Installation and configuration considerations</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQL admin toolset no longer supports Itanium</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Idera discontinued Itanium support in SQL admin toolset version 1.6 and later. However, versions 1.5 and earlier continue to operate with Itanium, but support for those versions is no longer available. For more information, see the <a href="Product Requirements.htm">product requirements</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQL admin toolset  uses the administrator
login by default on Windows Vista</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">Installing the SQL admin toolset in Windows Vista requires administrator credentials. If you launch the SQL admin toolset at the end of the installation, the product runs with that user login. Any settings saved by the user during that session are lost during the next restart, and it launches with a regular user logged in.</p>
