        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Password Checker</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Password Checker tool helps you evaluate and strengthen your SQL&#160;Server password policy, such as finding weak passwords that can make your SQL&#160;Servers vulnerable to outside attack. You can see exactly which logins are at risk so you can replace the weak passwords with strong passwords.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Password Checker tool allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet">Use proven approaches to test password strength, including use of built-in password lists.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Use a custom password list that enforces your specific corporate password policy.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Choose which logins you want to check.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Drill down to identify logins associated with weak passwords.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Save your test results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">By default, Password Checker           <a href="Configure Authentication.htm">connects</a> to the specified SQL&#160;Server instances using the credentials of your currently logged on Windows account.</p>
        <p class="Body">Password Checker then finds bad passwords by performing a dictionary scan against one of the built-in password lists provided with the Password Checker tool or against your own custom list.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Considerations before using the Password Checker tool</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Password Checker tool uses a list of common words to test for bad passwords. As a best practice, users should not use blank passwords, common words, or passwords that match a login name.  The Password Checker tool uses lists of common passwords compiled by industry experts.</p>
        <p class="Body">There are a number of factors you should consider before using the Password Checker. It is important that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet">Decide whether you need to check specific SQL&#160;Server instances or a server group.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Ensure the <a href="Configure Authentication.htm">authentication account</a> has CONTROL SERVER&#160;or sysadmin privileges on each instance you intend to check.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Choose which password list you want to use for the check. You can check against your own password, a custom password file, or one of the built-in password lists. You can also check for blank passwords.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">You can use Manage Server Groups and SQL&#160;Discovery with the Password Checker tool to further enhance your validation. These other tools work with the Password Checker tool in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Manage Server Groups</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Use <a href="Manage Server Groups.htm">Manage Server &#160;Groups</a> to create logical groups of SQL&#160;Server instances. By creating a server group, you can easily check passwords on instances that are mission-critical or host  sensitive data.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQL&#160;Discovery</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">Use <a href="SQL Discovery.htm">SQL&#160;Discovery</a> to find SQL&#160;Server instances on your network, and then use the Password Checker tool to test the security of those instances. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Use the Password Checker tool</h2>
        <p class="StepIntro">To check a password using the Password Checker tool:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Open the Idera SQL&#160;admin toolset Launchpad, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Password Checker</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Specify whether you want to check passwords on a SQL&#160;Server instance or a server group.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Search for and then select the SQL Server instance or server group whose backup status you want to check. To specify multiple SQL Servers, separate each instance name with a semicolon.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Check the options of passwords you want to check against. You can use:&#160;<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">Top 10 List</span>. Contains the most popular passwords as defined by <em>PC&#160;Magazine</em> and actually contains 11 passwords as a blank password is in the list.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">Blank password and passwords matching login</span>. Contains a blank password plus any passwords that match the user account used to log in to the system.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">Nifty Fifty</span>. Contains 50 of the most commonly used passwords including a blank password and the user name as a password.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">Other</span>. Allows you to specify specific passwords to look for.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">800 Common Passwords</span>. Contains 800 of the most commonly used passwords including a blank password and the user name as a password.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">Custom List</span>. Allows you to attach a file to check passwords against.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body"><span class="GUI_Item">The Big List (2400+ Passwords)</span>. Contains over 2400 of the most commonly used passwords including a blank password and the user name as a password.</li><li class="Bullet-Def-Body-Last"><span class="GUI_Item">Test Common Variations of Selected Passwords</span>. Checks different variations of passwords already selected using one of the previous check boxes.</li></ul></li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Specify which logins you want to check on the selected SQL&#160;Servers, separating each login name with a semicolon. Always check logins containing  elevated privileges, such as members of the built-in server roles.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click <span class="GUI_Item">Check Passwords</span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">View the results. </li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you want to view login details for a specific SQL&#160;Server instance</span>, click the appropriate login listed in the <span class="GUI_Item">Test Results</span> right pane.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you want to save the results</span>, right-click to save the results as a TXT, XML,&#160;or CSV file.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Create a custom password list</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Password Checker tool allows you to attach a document containing a custom list of passwords to check against. You can attach this list using the <span class="GUI_Item">Custom List</span> check box, and then searching for and selecting the appropriate file.</p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To create a custom password list using the Password Checker list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Open a text editor program, such as Notepad.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Type each word or phrase on individual lines. This list should represent strings that should not be used in SQL&#160;Server login passwords.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Save the file in a secured folder.</li>
        </ol>
